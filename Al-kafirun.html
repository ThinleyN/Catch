Being in an interlanguage sequential system the errors and manipulation occurring in the process of translation, cannot simply and merely be interpreted as a misconception, but rather a text generator improvisation via a translation machine. In an extreme situation, the newly generated text could resemble Shathiyat or lettrist poetry. The concept considered as a “lost meaning” is actually a fluid reproduction of an improviser source. This source has a completely different perception and cognition from the early one and this path could be ironically bizarre. A python script utilizes google translate engine for translating between 103 supported languages, the output of each translation in each step is always the input for the next round and in the whole time the English translation is displayed above the new translated sentence. The titles are the first input sentences which here are the six verses of the Unbelievers Surah of Quran generating 6 short narratives recorded in a video format.
