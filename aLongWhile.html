                    A long while is an experimental video work that employs an editing methodology based on the idea of reclaiming leap seconds established by our institutionalized regulation of time. The precision of modern time calculation has led to a discrepancy in measured values. Hence, a leap second needs to be periodically added, functioning as a suspended moment, while we wait for the earth to catch up. As a reflection of this, the composition, decomposition, and re-composition of the video’s narrative is performed by a metronome that follows a 37 degree/second subtractive structure. A decolonial re-narration unfolds as the artists appropriate the two characters from Hans Holbein painting “The Ambassadors”. They impersonate a journey through an atemporal ocean, subjected to the monotony of sea travel and a heavy feeling of boredom. The work ponders on the weight placed by western society on the precision of time keeping to sustain efficiency and productivity.
