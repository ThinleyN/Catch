                  Catch Me Who Can is an investigation into various modes of organization, access, and retrieval within image data banks. Questioning how different mechanisms of order influence our reading and understating of images. How certain meanings emerge, change, and stretch when algorithms act upon images and when they are framed in pages of a book.

                  The project explores nearly one thousand protest images, collected and grouped around COCO objects. COCO (common objects in context) is a large-scale training database widely used in computer vision. It contains images of ‘’91 object types that are meant to be easily recognizable by a 4-year-old’’.  However, in this new assembly, objects are extracted from their previous narrative, they are invited to become fragments in telling the stories of protests and struggles.

                  While the train discloses images in brief flashes, the accompanying book captures them alongside extended notes, addressing the connection between language and the use of captions in describing images.
